# BitMagic the Debugger

The idea is to add the [Debug Adaptor Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) to the Emulator and combined with a X16 specific VSC extension to provide a rich development experience.

This is reliant on the Emulator being in a working state, so has not yet been started.
